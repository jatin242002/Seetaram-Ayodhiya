                <h3>Background and History</h3>
                <p>The Ramayana is one of the longest epic poems in Hinduism, with more than 24,000 verses. Although its
                    precise origins are unclear, the poet Valmiki is generally credited with writing the Ramayana in the
                    5th century B.C. The text is considered one of India's two major ancient epics, the other being the
                    Mahabharata.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <h3>Synopsis of the Story of Ramayana</h3>
                <p>Rama, the prince of Ayodhya, is the eldest son of King Dasharatha and his wife Kaushalya. Although
                    Rama is his father's choice to succeed him, the king's second wife, Kaikei, wants her own son on the
                    throne. She schemes to send Rama and his wife Sita into exile, where they remain for 14 years.
                    <br>
                    While living in the forest, Sita is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana, the 10-headed ruler of
                    Lanka. Rama pursues her, aided by his brother Lakshmana and the mighty monkey general Hanuman. They
                    attack Ravana’s army and succeed in killing the demon king, freeing Sita after a fierce battle and
                    reuniting her with Rama.
                    <br>
                    Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya and are warmly welcomed back by the citizens of the kingdom, where
                    they rule for many years and have two sons. Eventually, Sita is accused of being unfaithful, and she
                    must undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. She appeals to Mother Earth and is saved, but
                    she vanishes into immortality.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Major Themes</h3>
                <p>Though their actions in the text, Rama and Sita come to embody the ideals of matrimony through their
                    devotion and love for one another. Rama inspires loyalty among his people for his nobility, while
                    Sita's self-sacrifice is seen as the ultimate demonstration of chastity. Rama's brother Lakshmana,
                    who chose to be exiled with his sibling, embodies familial loyalty, while Hanuman's performance on
                    the battlefield exemplifies bravery and nobility.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Influence on Popular Culture</h3>
                <p>As with the Mahabharata, the Ramayana's influence spread as Hinduism expanded throughout the Indian
                    subcontinent in the centuries after it was written. Rama's victory over evil is celebrated during
                    the holiday of Vijayadashami or Dussehra, which takes place in September or October, depending on
                    when it falls during the Hindu lunisolar month of Ashvin.
                    <br>
                    The folk drama Ramlila, which recounts the story of Rama and Sita, is frequently performed during
                    the festival, and effigies of Ravana are burned to symbolize the destruction of evil. The Ramayana
                    has also been a frequent subject of movies and TV miniseries in India, as well as an inspiration to
                    artists from ancient to contemporary times.

                <h3>Further Reading</h3>
                <p>With more than 24,000 verses and 50 chapters, reading the Ramayana is no simple task. But for the
                    Hindu faith and non-Hindus alike, the epic poem is a classic worth reading. One of the best
                    sources
                    for Western readers is a translation by Steven Knapp, a practicing American Hindu with an
                    interest
                    in the faith's history and scholarship.

                <h3>Rama is born</h3>
                <p>Dasharath, king of Ayodhya, had no children. So he arranged a Putra-kameshti sacrifice (putra = son,
                    kameshti = that which is desired). At the sacrifice, Agni (god of fire) arose from the flames and
                    handed the king a golden vase brimming with nectar. "Give this to your queens", said the god and
                    disappeared. The king had three wives. To the eldest, the king gave half of the nectar; the second
                    queen got a portion that remained when the queen had drunk her half. To the youngest queen, the king
                    gave the remaining half of the nectar and again, the second queen got the portion that remained. In
                    time, the queens gave birth to sons: to the eldest was born Rama, to the youngest was born Bharat,
                    and to the second queen were born the twins Lakshman and Shatrughna.</p>

                <h3>Rama marries Sita</h3>
                <p>When the princes had grown up some, the sage Vishwamitra arrived at Dasharath's court and asked that
                    Rama and Lakshman be "lent" to him to help him rid his hermitage of the demons that were plaguing
                    the ashram dwellers by defiling their sacrifices with blood and bones, and by killing them off.
                    After the two princes successfully rid the ashram of the demons, the sage took them to the
                    neighbouring kingdom of Mithila to show them the swayamvar festivities of the Mithila princess,
                    Sita, born of the earth. The king of that country had adopted Sita as his daughter and, after Sita
                    had grown up, had declared that he would give her in marriage to anyone who could string the Great
                    Bow of Shiva. No one could. Several kings, princes, and commoners had tried and failed.
                    <img class="photo01" src="../Image-Vediao/22.avif" alt="22"><br>
                    The swayamvar had been in progress for several months now and the bow still remained unstrung. It
                    was to this place that the sage Vishwamitra brought the two princes of Ayodhya. Rama and Lakshamn
                    entered the assembly hall where the bow was displayed in all its glory. Rama walked over, picked up
                    the bow, strung it, and plucked the bowstring with such a twang that two things happened
                    simultaneously: the twang was heard for miles around, and the force of it broke the bow into two
                    with so great a sound that the king and his courtiers came running from their chambers to see what
                    the commotion was about. When the confusion had settled, Rama was married to Sita. His three
                    brothers were married to a sister and cousins of Sita, and there were many festivities and much
                    rejoicing in the two kingdoms.

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Rama is exiled</h3>
                <p>Some time later, Dasharath decided he had grown too old to rule and declared he would abdicate in
                    favour of Rama, the eldest born and the crown prince. This is when his youngest queen invoked an old
                    promise that Dasharath had made to her: she demanded that Rama be exiled for 14 years and that her
                    own son, Bharat, be crowned king. Dasharath refused but Rama decided to honour his father's old
                    promise and left for the forests. He was accompanied by Sita and by Lakshman, both of whom could not
                    be dissuaded from following him. In grief at the injustice of it all and at Rama's departure,
                    Dasharath died within two days.
                </p>
                <img class="photo01" src="../Image-Vediao/20.webp" alt="20">
                <p>
                    Bharat was not in Ayodhya when these events happened; he, and the fourth prince Shatrughna, were
                    away holidaying at Bharat's maternal grandfather's country. They were summoned to Ayodhya in haste
                    and, when Bharat learnt what had happened, he was furious. He shouted at his mother, refused to
                    ascend the throne, and gathered the townsfolk around him to proceed to the forest and bring Rama
                    back.
                    <br>
                    Rama refused to return, stating his intention to serve his father's last wish by being an exile for
                    the full 14 years. Bharat returned with Rama's sandals, placed them on the throne, and proceeded to
                    rule the country in Rama's name. Meanwhile, Rama moved further south even deeper into the forests so
                    that the people of Ayodhya would not find it easy to keep coming to his hut and begging him to
                    return.

                <h3>Ravana abducts Sita</h3>
                <p>One day, a demoness named Surpanakha saw Rama and, being charmed out of her wits by his beauty,
                    walked up to him and begged him to marry her. "I already have a wife", said Rama and pointed to
                    Sita. "Why don't you marry my brother Lakshman instead?" When Surpanakha turned towards Lakshman, he
                    declared he'd taken a temporary vow of celibacy and sent her back to Rama. What followed was that
                    the brothers took turns to thus play ping-pong with her and when Surpanakha, by now angry beyond
                    measure, rushed towards Sita to kill her, Lakshmana cut off Surpanakha's nose and ears.</p>
                <img class="photo1" src="../Image-Vediao/28.jpg" alt="28">
                <p>
                    Surpanakha flew towards Lanka (modern Sri Lanka), ruled by her brother Ravana, and complained.
                    Enraged, Ravana vowed vengeance. He persuaded the demon Marich to disguise himself as a golden deer
                    and wander near Rama's hut. When Sita saw the golden deer, she begged Rama to get it for her. When
                    the brothers were out pursuing the deer, Ravana arrived, abducted Sita, placed her in his flying
                    chariot, and flew through the skies to Lanka. When the princes, after having killed the golden deer
                    and discovered it was a demon in disguise, returned to their hut, they found it empty and started to
                    look for Sita.

                <h3>Rama meets Hanuman</h3>
                <img class="smallp" src="../Image-Vediao/23.jpg" alt="23"><br>
                <p>During their wanderings, the princes came upon a group of monkeys who showed them some ornaments of
                    Sita's: the monkeys had seen a beautiful lady crying and dropping her ornaments from a chariot in
                    the sky that was being driven southwards by a demon. <br>
                    Among the monkeys was Hanuman, who ultimately located Sita's whereabouts to be in Ravana's kingdom
                    in Lanka. Rama gained the help of the monkey chief Sugreeva, gathered a monkey army, marched
                    southwards, built a bridge across the ocean and crossed over to Lanka. Rama, after an epic battle,
                    was then able to kill Ravana and finally free Sita.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <h3>The Search For Sita Begins</h3>
                <p>As the search for Sita continues, Ram and Lakshman came across a strange headless creature called
                    Kabandha. The demon was cursed by a sage. Lord Rama agreed to free him from the monster’s body.
                    After than, he helped Rama and Lakshmana to find the River Pampa. He advised Rama to seek the help
                    of mighty vanar king Sugriva. Sugriva was thrown out of his Kingdom by his brother. So if Ram and
                    Lakshman agreed to help him reconquer his throne then Sugriva would help them in their quest to
                    rescue Sita from Lanka.
                    <br>
                    On their way, they came across an ashram owned by an old lady called Shabari. She recognized the two
                    prince’s and offered them a bowl full of berries. The next day, they left to reach to the Vanar
                    king.

                <h3>The Battle Between Baali And Sugriva</h3>
                <p>Sugriva felt more optimistic about his chances with Rama by his side. Sugriva challenged Baali to a
                    fight as suggested by Rama. Rama, on the other hand, was unable to distinguish between the two
                    during the combat, which resulted in Sugriva’s defeat. Sugriva agreed to call a rematch after Rama
                    asked Sugriva to do so. Sugriva went to the match with a garland this time. Rama threw an arrow at
                    Baali mid-battle, piercing his heart and killing him, now that he could readily tell the two
                    brothers apart.

                Baali realised his mistake and begged Sugriva’s forgiveness in his final moments. Sugriva was
                re-crowned king of Kishkindha, and he sent his army to aid Rama in his fight against Raavan.

                <h3>Hanuman Leads The Search For Sita</h3>
                <p>In search of Sita, Hanuman, Angad, Jambuwan, and others travelled to the southern coast of India.
                    They knew Lanka was located at the extreme tip.
                    Nobody was sure what to do next. Hanuman was adamant about not returning to Ram until he had
                    confirmed Sita’s whereabouts. They sat on a large boulder near the ocean’s edge. Behind them, in a
                    nearby cave, a massive vulture, almost starving, was delighted to discover these folks as prey! His
                    name was Sampati. He had a tremendously sensitive sense of hearing, vision, and smell. He has such
                    strength that he could consume a whole human in one bite! As a result, he planned to eat one of them
                    to satisfy his long-standing appetite.
                    <br><img class="photo01" src="../Image-Vediao/24.jpg" alt="24">
                    Jatayu’s older brother was Sampati. No sooner did he hear Hanuman talk about Jatayu and his brave
                    act to protect Sita from the hands of Ravana than Sampati went closer to them to inquire more.
                    Hanuman described Jatayu’s brave deed in the attempt to save Sita. He also told Sampati about Ram,
                    Lakshman, and Sita, as well as Ravan’s kidnapping of Sita. After that, Sampati decided to assist Ram
                    in his effort to defeat Ravan and save Sita.
                    <br>
                    Immediately Hanuman started growing in size. He became larger and larger. It was Hanuman who could
                    reach Lanka with his magical abilities. He then prayed to Pavan Dev, Lord Indra, Surya and Bramha.
                    He asked them all for their help and took a long leap from the beach with the intention to reach
                    Lanka.

                <p>Hanuman approached Sita as she sat under the tree. He quietly climbed down the tree and owed down to
                    her. At first she was a little shocked seeing a strange creature but Hanuman then presented a
                    special ring of Rama to her. Sita immediately recognized it. Hanuman informed Sita that he has come
                    as a messenger of Ram and she will be rescued soon. Sita then took out a precious jewel from her
                    hair and gave it to Hanuman as a token of offering for Ram. Hanuman was about to leave when he was
                    captured by the demons guarding the place.

                    Hanuman was captured by the demons, and was taken to Ravana. Ravana decided to light Hanuman’s tail
                    on fire. They soaked cotton strips in oil and wrapped his tail in cotton strips. As soon as the
                    demons were about to light Hanuman’s tail, Hanuman used a magical spell to make it grow longer.
                    Cotton and oil were exhausted but they lit his tail anyway.
                    <br>
                    Hanuman, on the other hand, has shrunk to the size of a mouse, and as a result, his tail has shrunk
                    as well. Therefore, he was able to flee, burning Ravana’s throne on fire and spreading a path of
                    flames over Lanka. Hanuman jumped back to Rama, Lakshman, and the bears after dipping his tail in
                    the sea. Many challenges and obstacles are yet to come.

                <h3>Peace Proposal</h3>
                <p>Ravan’s youngest brother, Vibhishan, accompanied Ram in his noble quest. The entire army arrived in
                    Lanka. Ram wanted to avoid a war, so he sent a peace proposal. In Ravan’s court, Angad was chosen to
                    represent Ram. Angad arrived in Ravan’s court and explained that Ram had sent him to secure Sita’s
                    release. Ram’s final appeal to Ravan should be heard to avoid a war.
                    <br><img class="photo01" src="../Image-Vediao/29.jpg" alt="29">
                    Ravan, on the other hand, did not accept the proposal. He advised Angad to go back and forget about
                    Sita, mockingly. The demons were then challenged by Agnad to move his leg by an inch. If they
                    succeed, the entire army would leave Lanka immediately. But no one, not even Ravan, could pull it
                    off.
                    <br>
                    Angry Ravan ordered the demons to capture Angad but he flew off. He reported back to Ram that there
                    is no other way to rescue Sita other than war. Thus, the entire started getting ready for a battle

            <div class="text">
                <h3>The Great Battle Starts</h3>
                <p>Ram, Laxman, Hanuman, Sugreev, and Vibhishan met to discuss their final plan. The Lankan guards were
                    attacked by Angad and his brave warriors. The guards were defeated after a brief battle, and Angad
                    and his group crossed the Lankan border . In order to defeat the demons, they positioned troops
                    everywhere. Ravan was alarmed by the news and dispatched an additional force to fight Ram’s men.
                    They, too, were beaten.
                    <br><img class="smallp" src="../Image-Vediao/31.jpg" alt="31">
                    Indrajit, Ravan’s son, was sent to defeat Ram. Indrajit hid behind a cloud and shot serpent arrows
                    towards Ram. This made Ravana very pleased. Lord Indra helped Ram and Lakshman in winning the battle
                    since they were fighting for the right. Ravan was upset by this, and in a desperate attempt to win,
                    he summoned Kumbhakarna, his powerful brother, to the court. Ravan believed Kumbhakarna could
                    overcome Ram and his army on his own.

            <div class="text">
                <h3>The Mighty Demons</h3>
                <p>Demon Kumbhakarna was so powerful that the King of Gods’ Indra himself was afraid of him. He was said
                    to remain awake for six months and sleep for next six months. If anyone would wake him up while he
                    slept, he would turn ferocious and would be so hungry that he would literally eat up every living
                    being he finds in his way.
                    <br>
                    It was very difficult to wake Kumbakarna up. They beat many drums, made elephant trumpets near his
                    ear but he would not wake up. Finally, they cooked much delicious and wonderful food and placed them
                    all around him. It finally helped Kumbarana to wake up. The enormous giant ate and drank everything.
                    He finally went to meet his brother, Ravan.
                    <br><img class="smallp" src="../Image-Vediao/30.jpg" alt="30">
                    Ravan then sent his brother armed with gigantic spears in the battlefield. Hanuman, Angad, and
                    Sugreev fought the huge demon but they all failer in stopping Kumbhkarna. He even moved passed the
                    arrows that Lakshman aimed at him. Finally, Ram took charge of the front himself. He used his
                    special weapon to defeat Kumbhkarna. He defeated the mighty demon.
                    <br>
                    Ravan was terribly upset on hearing about the death of his brother and blamed himself. Seeing Ravan
                    so upset his sons decided to take charge in the battlefield and defeat Ram, Lakshman and the army.
                    But one by one they all met their end by the warriors of the Vanar sena except for Meghnand or
                    Indrajit.

                <h3>Final Battle Between Lord Rama and Ravana</h3>
                <p>
                    he last important battle in the Ramayana was between Bhagavan Sri Ram and demon king Ravana. This was an all-important encounter. It was not easy to kill Ravana as he had powerful defense and magical powers. So how did Ram kill Ravana?
                    <br>

                    In the final battle both Ram and Ravana used several divine arrows against each other. All the arrows were nullified by them.
                    <br>
                    Finally, Sri Ram shot arrows and knocked off each of Ravana’s ten heads. But to the amazement of all standing in the battlefield, new head grew immediately. Each time a head appeared Ravana grew more powerful.
                    <br>
                    Finally, Sri Ram fired the Brahmastra, which was gifted to him by sage Agastya.
                    <br>
                    Sage Agastya had imparted this powerful arrow to Sri Ram while he resided in the Dandaka forest with his wife Mata Sita and brother, Lakshman.
                    <br>
                    Sage Agastya had also told Rama that whenever he needed a chariot, Matali, the charioteer of Indra, will bring the chariot of Indra. Rama attacked Ravana from the chariot driven by Matali as per Valmiki Ramayana.
                    <br>
                    The Brahmastra pierced through chest of Ravana. He fell down chanting the name of Bhagavan Sri Ram.

                <h3>End of War</h3>
                <p>The war was over and Ravana was defeated. Sita was found and rescued. Many versions of the Ramayana
                    end with Sita and Rama returning to their kingdom after fourteen years of exile, and the beginning
                    of Lord Ram’s glorious reign.</p>

                <p>When Sita walked up to Rama, however, he refused to accept her since she had been a living in a
                    demon's palace all this while. Hurt, Sita entered into a burning pyre intending to give up her life.
                    However, Agni rose from the flames, carrying an unhurt Sita in his arms and said:</p>

                <p>Since the 14 years were over by now, Rama then returned to Ayodhya, was crowned king, and ruled the
                    kingdom with great wisdom: no child died before their parents did, no door needed locks against
                    robbers, no farmland lay barren, no tree went fruitless, and there was peace and prosperity all
                    around.</p>

                <h3>Sita is banished</h3>
                <p>The Ramayana, as composed by Valmiki, is thought to have six chapters and to end at this happy point.
                    A seventh chapter, called the Uttar-Ramayana (uttar = post, after, that which comes later) continues
                    the story and ends on a slightly less happy note. This is how the story continues: After many months
                    of Rama's rule, rumours began to surface among the populace regarding Sita's chastity since she had
                    been abducted and imprisoned by a demon. Mindful of the feelings of his subjects, Rama asked Sita to
                    undergo an Agni Pareeskha again. Sita refused, whereupon Rama banished her. Lakshman was deputed to
                    escort her out of the kingdom; he did so unwillingly and left Sita near the hermitage of Valmiki.

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Lava & Kush sing the Ramayana</h3>
                <p>Sita was pregnant at that time. Valmiki took her in as an ashram inmate, and she gave birth to her
                    twins there: sons named Lava and Kush whom Valmiki brought up with great love and affection,
                    teaching them princely skills such as archery as well as scholarly skills such as the Vedas and
                    other scriptures. Valmiki also taught them to sing the Ramayana, which he had finished composing by
                    this time. The twins, who were unaware of their parentage and, hence, unaware that they were singing
                    about their own family, would recite the poem at gatherings. They became so well-loved for their
                    sweet recitation that their fame reached Rama's ears who summoned them for a performance. It was
                    here at Rama's court that the true story was revealed to the twins: that they, spitting images of
                    the king, were his sons and that their mother was none other than the Sita whom they sang of.

                    Rama, in remorse, asked Sita to return to the palace if she could prove her chastity again before an
                    assembly. Sita, in anguish, cried out, "O mother earth, just take me away from this place forever!"
                    Whereupon the ground parted, the goddess Prithivi arose on a golden throne, took Sita in her lap,
                    descended, and the rift closed. Sita was forever lost. Griefstricken, Rama decided to live no
                    longer. He abdicated the throne in favour of his sons and, along with his brothers, entered the
                    waters of the river Sarayu that skirted Ayodhya; their spirits left their bodies and ascended to the
                    heavens.
